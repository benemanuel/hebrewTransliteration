    <h2>What's the best text to use?</h2>
    <p>
      Any unicode Hebrew text will work. You can enter the text yourself or copy
      and paste the text from your favorite online Hebrew Bible.
    </p>
    <h2>Some transliterations don't seem right.</h2>
    <p>
      There are a few known issues. Defectively written long vowels are not
      properly transliterated nor short vowels written using a mater. The qamtas
      qatan is not always accurate as well.
    </p>
    <h2>What should I do if I find something wrong?</h2>
    <p>Feel free to send me a message through GitHub or Academia.edu.</p>
    <h2>Can I work on the code myself?</h2>
    <p>Yes! The code is freely available on GitHub. Hack away!</p>
